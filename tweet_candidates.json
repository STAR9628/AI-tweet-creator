    "tweet_a": "iPhone 17 Pro Max is HERE! 🤯 A18 Pro chip + that new zoom camera? Get ready for some serious upgrades. \n\nWhat are you most excited about? 👇 #iPhone17ProMax #TechLaunch #Apple",
    "tweet_b": "iPhone 17 Pro Max is HERE! 🚀 A18 Pro chip + CRAZY new zoom camera means your pics are about to get next-level. Prepare for mind-blowing photos & speed! #iPhone17ProMax #AppleEvent #TechGamerz 🔥🍎🤯 More info coming soon!",
    "tweet_a_vs_tweet_b": "Tweet B is slightly better because it uses more engaging emojis and language ('CRAZY new zoom camera', 'next-level', 'mind-blowing') which are more likely to grab attention and generate excitement. While both tweets are relevant and announce the iPhone 17 Pro Max, Tweet B's energetic tone and slightly more descriptive language about the camera's impact make it marginally more relatable and engaging for a general audience interested in photography and speed.",
    "prediction": "tweet_b",
    "explanation": "Tweet B uses more evocative language ('CRAZY', 'next-level', 'mind-blowing') and a greater variety of emojis (🚀, 🔥, 🍎, 🤯) which generally leads to higher engagement. Both tweets are relevant to the iPhone 17 Pro Max launch. Tweet B's emphasis on the outcome of the new features (better photos, speed) might resonate slightly better with a broader audience than Tweet A's more direct feature announcement."
